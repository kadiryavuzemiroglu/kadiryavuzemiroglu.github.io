                        <p>
                            My academic research examines authoritarian regimes through the lens of urban space,
                            governance, and everyday life. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observation,
                            I explore how state power manifests in design, destruction, and policing, shaping the lived
                            experiences of citizens.

                                One of the largest mobile card game companies in the world needed to understand their

                        In many ways, storytelling is woven into nearly every aspect of my life. I write for personal
                        and professional blogs, as well as various publications. I incorporated ethnographic drawings of
                        architectural scenes into my PhD dissertation—a practice that has since become a habit for
                        documenting human experiences. I also translated works such as <em>The Railway</em> by Hamid
                        Ismailov and <em>Dubliners</em> by James Joyce.
